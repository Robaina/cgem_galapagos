# Reconstructing a cGEM for the most abundant marine microbial species in Galápagos


__Plan__:

1. Select GEMs for the most abundant marine microbial species in the dataset, represented by their families in [S3 Table](cgem_galapagos/data/Table_3.XLSX)
2. Build cGEM and analyze with MICOM
3. Input abundances to the cGEM as well as key environmental parameters: DOC, DIC, NO3, PO4, maybe chlorophyll as well
4. Analyze community changes (interactions) and growth rates for the four main scenarios: 2015, 2016, east and west, summarized in this [table](cgem_galapagos/outputs/Galapagos_Archipelago_Key_Changes.tsv).

__Data__:

1. Chlorophyll for small fraction (< 5 µm) and large fraction (> 5 µm), for bacterioplankton and phytoplankton, respectively.
